Is time equivalent to motion? to be more exact, is it equivalent to vibration? is vibration related to random pop-ups of sub-particles? after all, that random pop-ups are what, is responsible for ever-increasing entropy and thatâ€™s the flow of time my friend!!

Now vibrations and random pop-ups, a particle vibrates because it can't standstill otherwise it would defy the uncertainty principle, and random pop-ups of particles in empty space are because of the energy fluctuations of all the fundamental fields\(spread across the Universe\). And these fluctuations in the fields\(wave\) are again the result of the uncertainty principle\(it's an intrinsic property of wave\).

So can we conclude, time is therefore because of the uncertainty principle? Now have we just connected the two most distinct but successful theories i.e. general theory of relativity\(governs the cosmic world\) and quantum mechanics\(physics of the smallest world\)? Because time and motion seem to be the basis of gravitational theory and uncertainty principle is what governs the quantum world!!

No.. we need to include space, and how mass warps space, as well to fully connect the two.. will come back on this.. bye :\)
